          <h1>Let's talk business.</h1>
          <br>
          <h3>Tell me about yourself.</h3>
          <hr>
          <p class="body-p">I moved to Austin in June of 2017 from Wisconsin after graduating college to kickstart my career. Within my coursework, I studied web development, object-oriented programming, networking and computer support. I have two years of applied experience
            supporting and maintaining computer hardware and software in a help desk setting which I gained from electing to work in the IT Work Study program at my college. In addition to doing work study, I also worked as an adjunct community education
            instructor, teaching technology literacy classes for a year and a half.</p>
          <br>
          <p class="body-p"> To start my development career, I began working at VersaSuite in the summer of 2017. My responsibilities at VersaSuite included developing, maintaining and optimizing user interfaces in the VersaSuite HIS platform. I had also been appointed
            as team lead on a handful of projects focusing on optimization / QA of client-facing forms used for the documentation of hospital records.</p>
          <br>

          <p class="body-p">Upon leaving VersaSuite, I began working for TELUS International as a Geospatial Applications Support Engineer. My responsibilities include providing developer support to users of the Google Maps APIs. This process includes troubleshooting developer-submitted issues
            and requests while optimizing code and reaching out to developers through platforms such as Stack Overflow and the Google Public Issue Tracker.</p>

          <br>

          <h3>What motivates you?</h3>

          <hr>

          <p class="body-p">I am highly motivated when I am able to see the efforts of my work in a completed project. I feel a strong sense of pride when I build a working prototype of a website or program and imagine how the end result will be received once it is ready
            to go live. Looking back and seeing the project I worked on in action is what gives me the inspiration to continue working towards bigger, more meaningful projects. </p>

          <br>

          <h3>Where do you see yourself in five years?</h3>

          <hr>

          <p class="body-p">Within the next five years, I plan to continue working to learn new technologies and advancing my skills as a web developer. I plan to transition into a more development-oriented role as I work toward my career goal of becoming a front-end engineer.</p>

          <br>

          <h1>The fun stuff.</h1>

          <br>

          <h3>What do you like to do outside of work?</h3>

          <hr>

          <p class="body-p">Outside of work, I enjoy mountain biking, listening to music, camping and traveling. I consider myself both an avid car and motorcycle enthusiast with a particular interest in the vintage Japanese variety of both. I have always had an interest
            in computers and enjoyed playing video games and editing videos as a kid, but I did not begin to develop an interest in pursuing an information technology career until later in high school. As well as enjoying music as a fan, I also play piano
            and bass guitar. I have played in a handful of bands as both a keyboardist and a bassist.</p>
